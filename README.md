# 🛡️ BFSI Shield: Insider Threat Signal Detection

**BFSI Shield** is a high-tech cybersecurity command center designed to monitor, intercept, and analyze corporate communications in real-time. Specifically tailored for the **BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance)** sector, it uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) logic to detect malicious intent and prevent data exfiltration.

## 🚀 Core Functionalities
* **Secure Admin Node**: Access-controlled terminal protected by `bcryptjs` password hashing.
* **Comms Intercept Protocol**: Real-time simulation of intercepted employee messages across multiple departments.
* **Neural Risk Engine**: Custom JavaScript logic that categorizes threats into **High**, **Medium**, and **Low** severity based on keyword vectors.
* **Target Risk Rankings**: A dynamic leaderboard that calculates and visualizes employee threat levels using historical alert data.
* **Threat Isolation**: A protocol allowing administrators to "Isolate" and permanently remove threats from the live databank.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture (MERN Stack)
* **Frontend**: React.js with a "Cyber-Command" UI, utilizing glassmorphism and motion effects.
* **Backend**: Node.js & Express.js REST API for asynchronous threat processing.
* **Database**: MongoDB Atlas cloud-hosted database for persistent, encrypted storage.
* **Deployment**: Backend hosted on **Render**, Frontend hosted on **Vercel**.
